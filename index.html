                    <p>Hello! I am Alex. I am junior year student at Lewis and I’m studying computer science. I am Filipino.
                        I have 4 sisters, 0 brothers and am the middle child in my family. This means that
                        I am clearly the favorite child. I have 2 dogs, named Mack and Tank. I think old technology is extremely cool, especially old cameras.
                        I like making people laugh, good questions, and eventually want to
                        travel the world.

            <h2>Fun Fact</h2>
            <p>Last year I had the opportunity to study abroad in Japan for about a month!</p>
            <p>One philosophy that I thought was cool was the philosophy of ichigoichie
                which translates to “one time, one meeting”. It means that every moment is unique, so cherish it.
                (Also I practiced the curly quotes here.)
